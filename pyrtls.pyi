# pyrtls: rustls-based modern TLS for Python

[Latest version](https://pypi.org/project/pyrtls) |
[Documentation](https://pyrtls.readthedocs.io) |
[CI](https://github.com/djc/pyrtls/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amain)

pyrtls provides bindings to [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls), a modern Rust-based TLS implementation with an API that is
intended to be easy to use to replace the `ssl` module (but not entirely compatible with it).

In addition to being memory-safe, the library is designed to be more secure by default. As such,
it does not implement older protocol versions, cipher suites with known security problems, and
some problematic features of the TLS protocol. For more details, review the [manual](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/manual/index.html).

## Warning!

This project is just getting started. While rustls is mature, the Python bindings
are pretty new and not yet feature-complete.

      on platforms that have on, and searching for CA certificates in the system trust store on
      other platforms (like Linux and FreeBSD).

      of the operating system, but depends on the pyrtls package to deliver timely updates.

      - A `TrustAnchor` object, which is a wrapper around a `webpki::TrustAnchor` object
      - A `bytes` object containing a DER-encoded certificate
